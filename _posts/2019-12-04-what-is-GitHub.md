## What is GitHub

### GitHub is a Git repository hosting service


Git is a version control system, and is used primarily via the command line. GitHub is a web-based graphical interface that allows forking, pull requests, and merging, all through a single location. This facilitates collaboration on projects by easily combining code from many authors.
