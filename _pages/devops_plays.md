# OI&T delivery teams build quality products by embracing the following tenets:

## Default to "yes"
* Saying yes doesn't mean you'll drop everything and address an issue - the challenge is how to manage changing information, user-driven goals and priorities

## Secure on Day 1
* We don't skimp on security.  
* Automation in pipeline assures code review at the first line of code.  
* Verify security early and often.  Resolve findings early.  Waiting until late in the process is expensive and encourages perpetual deferring of issues.

## Build quality in
* Verify quality early and often.  Use a variety of techniques to balance quick feedback with comprehensive coverage.

## Work in small batches
* By splitting work up into much smaller chunks that deliver measurable business outcomes quickly for a small part of our target market, we get essential feedback on the work we are doing so that we can course correct. 
* A key goal of continuous delivery is changing the economics of the software delivery process so the cost of pushing out individual changes is very low.

## Use Cloud-first
* Always deploy into a scalable and resilient infrastructure

## Advance Cloud Native
* Provide Open Source solutions with minimum vendor lock-in while leveraging Platform as a Service where it makes sense.
* Give back to Open Source solutions by contributing new featuers and resolves defects encountered along the way.

## Go API-first / microservices
* May the best tech win (or most appropriate for the job!).

## Commit to automation
* Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems.
* Reduce the "long tail" of operational costs by streamlining and continuous improvement of operational procedures
* Test the end-to-end service

## Default to 30 minute meetings
* Protect team members time and context switching by communicating openly outside of meetings, always having an agenda, and always timeboxing agenda items
