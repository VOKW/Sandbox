# Monitoring
* Review Google Analytics to measure performance and user progress through the service
* Review site performance data
* Review user feedback collected from the Call Center
* Conduct surveys to collect broad feedback
* Conduct interviews and usability testing to more deeply understand the problems users identified
* Conduct user research to understand new or evolving user needs

# Analyzing
## In analyzing the data you collect through monitoring, youâ€™ll develop:

* A deeper understanding of how users experience your service
* Insight into usability, accessibility, and technical issues and how to fix them
* Ideas for ways to improve your service in the future

# Prioritizing
## As new problems are uncovered through monitoring and analysis, add new features to your backlog to fix them. Rank these features by priority.
