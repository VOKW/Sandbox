## Steps to reproduce the behavior

  Describe the steps you took for this problem to exist. Such as: you installed
  the theme, customized _config.yml, added your own posts, and started up a 
  Jekyll server locally.

  If an error occurred on GitHub Pages when pushing, please test a local version
  following these setup instructions:
